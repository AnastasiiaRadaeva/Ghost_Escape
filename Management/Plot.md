Title: "Ghost Escape"

Plot:

In "Ghost Escape," the player takes on the role of a ghost who is trapped in a haunted house. The game is a 2D arcade-style game, similar to Pac-Man, where the player must navigate through a maze while avoiding obstacles and enemies.

Act 1: Trapped in the Haunted House

The game opens with the ghost awakening to find itself trapped in a haunted house. The ghost must navigate through the maze-like corridors, avoiding traps and obstacles, and collecting power-ups that will help it escape.

Act 2: The Final Escape

As the ghost nears the end of the maze, it must face a final challenge: escaping from the house itself. The ghost must avoid traps and enemies while making its way to the front door, where it can escape into the night.

Act 3: The Three Endings

There are three different endings to "Ghost Escape," depending on the player's actions throughout the game:

The Good Ending: If the player successfully escapes the haunted house without harming any of the other ghosts or creatures inside, they will be rewarded with the "good" ending. The ghost will be free to roam the world and explore new adventures.

The Bad Ending: If the player causes harm to other ghosts or creatures in the house, they will be rewarded with the "bad" ending. The ghost will be cursed to roam the haunted house forever, unable to escape.

The Secret Ending: There is a secret ending that can be unlocked by collecting all of the power-ups and completing the maze in a certain amount of time. In this ending, the ghost discovers that it was not alone in the haunted house after all, and makes a surprising new friend. Together, they embark on a new adventure outside of the haunted house, leaving their former home behind.
